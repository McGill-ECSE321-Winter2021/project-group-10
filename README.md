Welcome to project 10's Auto Repair Shop App wiki!  

## **Scope of our project**  
The project is for developing a system for an auto repair shop that supports the owner of the business in the appointment booking process. The auto repair shop requires the development of the system so that customers do not have to rely on the administrative assistant to book them an appointment, but can access the system via the website or their own mobile devices. Users would be able to not only view the list of services and make their appointments but also pay their bills in the system.
